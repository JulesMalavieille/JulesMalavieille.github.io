I am currently in the final year of a Masterâ€™s degree in Biological Oceanography and Marine Ecology at Aix-Marseille University, with a specialization in mathematical modelling and data analysis.

This site is a portfolio showcasing a selection of academic work and personal projects at the intersection of mathematics, system dynamics and computer science.

My interests span several fields, including bifurcation theory, chaos theory, stochastic modelling, and machine learning. I enjoy applying rigorous mathematics to real-world problems, building tools, and exploring complex system dynamics. My goal is to design rigorous models that help understand, anticipate or reproduce all types of dynamics.
