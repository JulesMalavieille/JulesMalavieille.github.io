## Modelling shift regime and Early Warning Signal

This project take place during my first internship with Jean-Christophe Poggiale in summer 2024. The goal was to describe shift regime with a classic model of spruce worm and try to predict it with early warning signals including rising of variance and autocorrelation.

This model describe the evolution of the spruce worm, *Ibs typographus*
