## Modelling shift regime and Early Warning Signal

This project take place during my first internship with Jean-Christophe Poggiale in summer 2024. The goal was to describe shift regime with a classic model of spruce worm and try to predict it with early warning signals including rising of variance and autocorrelation.

This model describe the evolution of the spruce worm, *Ibs typographus*. This worm creates holes in epicea and kills them. If the amount of worms is low, the resilience and reproduction of epicea mainain the forest. After a certain threshold of worms, the forest is destroyed extremely fast. This is a regime shift.

In order to modelise this dynamic, we used this model :
