# Formation 

## Master's Degree in Biological Oceanography and Marine Ecology
Specialitypecialization : Functions and Dynamics of Ecosystems
Aix-Marseille University, OSU pyth√©as institute
2024-2026

This degree places strong emphasis on dynamics of ecosystems, which strongly needs modelisation and data analysis
I gain expertise in : 
  - Mechanistic modelling dynamics of classic, chaotic and complex systems
  - Differential equations of all types (ordinary, stochastical or partial derivates)
  - Game theory
  - Advanced data analysis (ACP, AFCM, ANMS, CAH, Fourrier transforms)
  - Machine and Deep learning 

## Bachelor's Degree in Marine Sciences
Specializations : Mathematics and Computer Science 
Aix-Marseille University
2021-2024, Major of promotion

In this programm, I gained a solid interdisciplinarity foundation in both formal and natural sciences
I studied : 
  - Mathematics (linear algebra, differential systems, dalculus)
  - Statistics (bayesian statistics, testing hypothesis, Basic statistic metrics)
  - Computer Sciences (Python, numerical methods, Fortran, Latex)
  - Ecology
  - Basis of Oceanography (Biology, Chemistry and Physics)

## French Baccalaureat (High school Diploma)
Chevreul Lestonnac, Lyon, France
2021, Graduated with Honours

Sepcialized courses :
  - Mathematics
  - Biology
  - Physics and Chemistry
