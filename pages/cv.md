# Formation 

## Master's Degree in Biological Oceanography and Marine Ecology
Specialization : Functions and Dynamics of Ecosystems,
Aix-Marseille University, OSU pythéas institute,
2024-2026

This degree places strong emphasis on the dynamics of ecosystems, which requires advanced mathematical modelling and data analysis skills

I gained expertise in : 
  - Mechanistic modelling of dynamic, chaotic and complex systems
  - Differential equations : ordinary, stochastic and partial 
  - Game theory
  - Advanced data analysis (PCA, FAMD, ANMS, Clustering, Fourier transforms, etc...)
  - Machine learning and Deep learning 

## Bachelor's Degree in Marine Sciences
Specialization : Mathematics and Computer Sciences, 
Aix-Marseille University,
2021-2024, Ranked first in class

This program provide a strong interdisciplinary foundation across both formal and natural sciences

I studied : 
  - Mathematics (linear algebra, differential systems, calculus)
  - Statistics (Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics)
  - Computer Sciences (Python, numerical methods, Fortran, LaTeX)
  - Ecology
  - Fundamentals of Oceanography (Biology, Chemistry and Physics)

## French Baccalauréat (High school Diploma)
Chevreul Lestonnac, Lyon, France,
2021, Graduated with Honours

Specialization :
  - Mathematics
  - Biology
  - Physics and Chemistry
